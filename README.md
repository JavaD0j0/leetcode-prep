# Interview Prep

This repository holds key concepts related to Algorithms and Data Structure concepts which are
great to review before any technical interview.

Solution to `Easy` and `Medium` LeetCode problems are provided as well (in Java).

## Practice Strategy

### Four Week Plan

#### Week 1: Core Concepts and Easy to Medium Problems

    Focus Areas: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Hash Maps/Sets.
    Algorithms: Sorting, Binary Search.
    Practice Problems: Start with easy problems on these topics, and quickly move to medium-level problems.
    Daily Goal: Solve 1-2 problems, focusing on writing code without running it.

#### Week 2: Recursion and Advanced Data Structures

    Focus Areas: Trees (Binary Trees, BSTs), Heaps, Graphs.
    Algorithms: Recursion, BFS, DFS.
    Practice Problems: Focus on problems that require recursive thinking, tree traversal, and graph algorithms.
    Daily Goal: Solve at least 2 medium-level problems, try solving them in 15 minutes or less.

#### Week 3: Optimization and Harder Problems

    Focus Areas: Dynamic Programming (if relevant), Divide-and-Conquer.
    Practice Problems: Mix of medium and hard problems. Include problems on dynamic programming and divide-and-conquer.
    Daily Goal: Solve 1-2 problems per day, with an emphasis on time and space optimization.

#### Week 4: Mock Interviews and Review

    Mock Interviews: Simulate real interview conditions using CoderPad or other tools. Time yourself strictly (15 minutes per problem).
    Review: Go over all topics again, especially those that are challenging.
    Daily Goal: Conduct mock interviews and review your performance critically. Focus on clarity, correctness, and speed.
